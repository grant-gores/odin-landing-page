# odin-landing-page
About: This project was a demo project to recreate a website layout provided by The Odin Project.
In this project I first laid out the entire structure of the page in HTML and then went back section by section to style the page with CSS.
I used flex-box to arrange the different sections and also added some content about Oslo Norway to make it prettier.
I also optionally added some logic for mobile layout for then the screen is minimized.
This project helped me create my first landing page ever!
